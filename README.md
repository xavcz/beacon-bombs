# Meteor Cordova Treasure hunt.
The objective of this game is to find and disarm a number of bombs(beacons). The game consists of a player or group with an iPhone app and several hidden Bluetooth beacons. The app has a proximity indicator - a circle changing color from blue to red depending on how close you are to the bomb you should disarm next. The proximity indicator indicates the distance a player is from the bomb by converting the signal strength of the beacon to the appropriate concentric circles color. The app also has a clue that should be unspecific, for eg "Under the bed", "Behind the chair", "Behind the painting". When the indicator is red, the player has reason to believe it is in the right room and can start looking for the bomb according to the clue. When the bomb is found there is a secret code written on the beacon. This code has to be entered into the app to disarm that bomb. The app also has a timer that counts down. If it reaches zero before the current bomb is disarmed the game is over. If the bomb is found and disarmed within the time limit, the countdown for the next bomb starts. The player that finds and disarms all 4 bombs in the fastest time wins.
