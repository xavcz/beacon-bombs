# beacon-bombs
Meteor Cordova treasure hunt
The objective of the game is to find and disarm bombs. The game consists of a player/group with an iphone app and several hidden bluethooth beacons. The app has an proximity indicator - a circle changing color from blue to red depending on how close you are to the bomb you should disarm next. This is done by converting the signal strength of the beacon to the circle color. The app also has a clue that should be unspecific, for eg "Under the bed", "Behind the chair", "Behind the painting". When the indicator is red, the player has reason to believe it is in the right room and can start looking for the bomb according to the clue. When the bomb is found there is a secret code written on the beacon. This code has to be entered into the app to disarm that bomb. The app also has a timer that counts down. If it reaches zero before the current bomb is found the game is over. If the bomb is found and disarmed within the time limit. The counter for the next bomb starts. The player that finds and disarms the most bombs wins.
